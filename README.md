# Student-Help Management App
Keeping proper track of student's records.

The first significant advantage of a student management system is that as a school you are able to keep proper
track of data related to students. This includes areas such as fees being paid by students, examination records of the students, 
transport facilities being provided by the school and availed by the students, and usage of libraries and other school facilities by the students.
As a school, you can access this data and more, by using a unique identification number of the student. In fact, apart from management people,
students can also use these systems in order to keep track of their dues as well as class schedules.
With the help of this system no longer would your admin guys need to type in all the data of the students as well as others in the school on excel sheets for long hours! 

It can all now be organized in a format that happens to be simple and accessible to one and all.
This also means that you would be able to access data within a few seconds, something that would not have been possible without such a system in place.
